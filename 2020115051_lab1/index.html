    <h2 ><u>&#39; Renewable Energy &#39;</u></h2>
	  <p>
        <em>Renewable energy </em> is useful energy that is collected from renewable resources, <strong> <em>are naturally replenished on a human timescale</em></strong>, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.The term often also encompasses biomass as well, whose carbon neutral status is under debate.This type of energy source stands in contrast to fossil fuels, which are being used far more quickly than they are being replenished.

	<h2><u>&#34;Growth of renewables&#34;</u></h2>
	    <p>
        From the end of 2004, worldwide renewable energy capacity grew at rates of 10â€“60% annually for many technologies. In 2015 global investment in renewables rose 5% to $285.9 billion, breaking the previous record of $278.5 billion in 2011. 2015 was also the first year that saw renewables, excluding large hydro, account for the majority of all new power capacity .

	<h2><u>Emerging technologies &#33;</u></h2>
	  <p>
        Other renewable energy technologies are still under development, and include cellulosic ethanol, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and marine energy.These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization. Many are on the horizon and may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on attracting sufficient attention and research, development and demonstration (RD&D) funding.
